# TimeTravelTrader

## What is this?

Another WIP, but the idea is a game in which you have a starting cash value of $25000, invest in stocks as a higher/lower game. Storyline is you have a messed up time machine (called TimeBroker Mk. 1) that gives you 2 period destination choices, and a crap, partially-omnipresent brokerage that only offers 1 stock per destination. You are investing your $25000 one of these 2 choices.

## Rules

1. Start off with $25,000
2. Select 1 company out of 2 choices to invest n%. Repeat until a set number of rounds
3. You are given basic company data (e.g., sector, market cap) and the time interval
4. You invest in the choices you make for only 1 year, before taking the P/L.

## Features

1. Play the daily retail challenge with an account to keep track of your decisions' growth as you play
2. Try Overleveraged, where you're too big to fail and must always choose the most profitable outcome
3. Simulate the daily life of hedgefund manager at TimeFunds, where you create the best portfolio for your clients using the slightly improved TimeBroker Mk. 2
